I wish it didn't have to come to this, but selami and his turkish friends are just creating fake buzz about this project to try and pump it so they can dump their millions of MAN tokens on unsuspecting fomo chasers. I have made my repos for the masternode and all the guides public as a deterrent against this scam of a project. They had the best intentions before covid hit, but then the team fell apart. They lost all their staff and it seems to just be owen left trying to make this look like it wasn't a total scam so they don't end up in jail.
I can't just let my hard work support selami and his scammy tactics.
Now he wants to pump the project and dump all his coins. He convinced his "friends" to buy tons of MAN and now they're all pissed at him. he's trying to save his own ass. Beware of this project

beware of this project
